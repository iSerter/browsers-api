- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently
  - Emerging best practices in the codebase

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });
  
  // Consider adding to [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
  - Remove rules that no longer apply
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with code
  - Update references to external docs
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes

## Project-Specific Rule Improvements

- **Action Handler Patterns**
  - Monitor new action handlers for common patterns
  - Update [nestjs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nestjs.mdc) with new handler patterns
  - Document error handling strategies
  - Add examples from actual handlers

- **DTO Evolution**
  - Track validation patterns across DTOs
  - Update [api-patterns.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/api-patterns.mdc) with new patterns
  - Document polymorphic DTO handling
  - Add complex validation examples

- **Testing Patterns**
  - Monitor test file organization
  - Update testing best practices based on what works
  - Document mock strategies for browser automation
  - Add examples from high-quality tests

- **Docker & Deployment**
  - Track deployment issues and solutions
  - Update [docker.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/docker.mdc) with new patterns
  - Document helper script conventions
  - Add troubleshooting guides from real issues

- **Development Workflow**
  - Monitor common developer questions
  - Update [development.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/development.mdc) with new workflows
  - Document frequently used commands
  - Add troubleshooting for common setup issues

## When to Update Project Rules

**Update [nestjs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nestjs.mdc) when:**
- A new action handler pattern emerges
- A better browser pool management pattern is discovered
- Job processing patterns evolve
- WebSocket event patterns change

**Update [api-patterns.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/api-patterns.mdc) when:**
- New endpoint patterns are established
- DTO validation strategies improve
- Authentication/authorization patterns change
- Response structure conventions evolve

**Update [docker.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/docker.mdc) when:**
- New helper scripts are created
- Docker configuration changes
- Performance optimization patterns emerge
- Troubleshooting solutions are discovered

**Update [development.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/development.mdc) when:**
- New development workflows are established
- Testing strategies improve
- Build processes change
- Common setup issues are resolved

## Monitoring Code Changes

- **Review Pull Requests for:**
  - Repeated validation patterns in DTOs
  - Common error handling in action handlers
  - Browser pool management patterns
  - Testing strategies for async operations
  - Docker configuration improvements

- **Track Issues for:**
  - Common developer setup problems
  - Testing difficulties
  - Docker/deployment issues
  - API design questions
  - Performance bottlenecks

- **Update Documentation When:**
  - New features are added (actions, endpoints)
  - Dependencies are updated (Playwright, NestJS)
  - Configuration changes significantly
  - Best practices are established through code reviews
