# Task 6 Implementation Summary: Job Processor Worker

## Overview
Implemented a complete job processor worker system that polls for pending jobs, executes them using browser automation, handles retries, and manages worker lifecycle with heartbeat monitoring.

## Components Implemented

### 1. JobLogService (`src/modules/jobs/services/job-log.service.ts`)
- Logs job events at different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Stores logs in database with metadata support
- Mirrors logs to console for debugging

### 2. WorkerHeartbeatService (`src/modules/jobs/services/worker-heartbeat.service.ts`)
- Manages worker heartbeat lifecycle
- Updates heartbeat every 10 seconds
- Health checking with 30-second timeout
- Started and stopped by worker manager

### 3. WorkerManagerService (`src/modules/jobs/services/worker-manager.service.ts`)
- Registers workers on startup
- Updates heartbeat every 10 seconds
- Detects and handles dead workers (heartbeat > 30 seconds old)
- Reassigns jobs from dead workers back to pending status
- Manages worker status (IDLE, BUSY, OFFLINE)
- Tracks current job assignment

### 4. JobProcessorService (`src/modules/jobs/services/job-processor.service.ts`)
**Main polling logic:**
- Polls for pending jobs every 1 second
- Uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to prevent race conditions between workers
- Immediately updates job status to `PROCESSING` to prevent duplicate processing
- Limits concurrent jobs to 5 per worker

**Job execution:**
- Acquires browser from pool based on browser type
- Creates browser context with viewport configuration
- Executes each action in sequence using ActionHandlers
- Collects all artifacts and results
- Releases browser back to pool after completion

**Error handling and retry logic:**
- **Retryable errors:** TimeoutError, NetworkError, BrowserError
- **Non-retryable errors:** InvalidURLError, AuthenticationError
- **Max retries:** 3 attempts
- **Exponential backoff:** retryCount² seconds
- Updates job status to `FAILED` after max retries exceeded

**Graceful shutdown:**
- Stops polling on module destroy
- Waits up to 60 seconds for active jobs to complete
- Releases all browser instances
- Updates worker status to stopped

## Database Features

### Job State Management
- Job status transitions: `PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED`/`FAILED`
- Timestamp tracking: `startedAt`, `completedAt`
- Error message storage in `errorMessage` field
- Result storage in JSON `result` field

### Worker Registration
- Auto-registration on module initialization
- Worker ID tracking
- Status management (IDLE, BUSY, OFFLINE)
- Current job assignment tracking
- Last heartbeat timestamp

## Integration

### Module Updates
- **JobsModule:** Added all new services to providers
- **WorkersModule:** Exported TypeOrmModule for entity access
- Imported WorkersModule into JobsModule

### Dependencies
- Uses existing `BrowserPoolService` for browser acquisition
- Uses existing `BrowserContextManagerService` for context management
- Uses existing `ActionHandlerFactory` for action execution
- Uses existing `ArtifactStorageService` (via handlers)

## Error Categories

1. **TimeoutError** - Page load timeout
2. **NetworkError** - Network connection failures
3. **BrowserError** - Browser-level errors
4. **InvalidURLError** - Invalid URL provided
5. **AuthenticationError** - Authentication failures
6. **UnknownError** - All other errors

## Retry Strategy

For retryable errors:
```typescript
backoffSeconds = retryCount²
// Attempt 1: 1s delay
// Attempt 2: 4s delay  
// Attempt 3: 9s delay
```

## Concurrency Control

- Polls with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to prevent race conditions
- Updates job status immediately to `PROCESSING`
- Limits to 5 concurrent jobs per worker
- Tracks active jobs in memory set

## Worker Lifecycle

1. **Registration:** On module initialization
2. **Polling:** Every 1 second for pending jobs
3. **Heartbeat:** Every 10 seconds
4. **Health Check:** Detects dead workers (heartbeat > 30s)
5. **Graceful Shutdown:** On module destroy

## Next Steps

- [ ] Write unit tests for all new services
- [ ] Integration testing with actual job execution
- [ ] Load testing with multiple concurrent workers
- [ ] Monitor worker health and performance metrics
- [ ] Consider adding job priority-based scheduling
- [ ] Implement job cancellation during processing
